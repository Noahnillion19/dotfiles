Hello. These are my dotfiles for Hyprland on Arch Linux (I use Arch btw).
# Things Changed
* Hyprland and Hyprpaper
* Waybar
* LightDM (with LightDM GTK Greeter)
* Qt6 (via qt6ct)
* GTK-3 (via nwg-look)
* Thunar
* Firefox prefs.js

Of course, everything listed here is optional.
# Installation
There is currently no way to install the dotfiles, I am working on the script. :)
